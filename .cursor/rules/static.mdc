# AI Rules for SalesAnalysis

SalesAnalysis (MVP) is a web application for B2B order recording and analysis that integrates data in one place and provides basic sales analytics and trends. The system enables manual order entry and XLSX import, order validation, amount calculations according to a defined algorithm, and metrics presentation on a dashboard.


## CODING_PRACTICES

### Guidelines for STATIC_ANALYSIS

#### ESLINT

- Configure project-specific rules in eslint.config.js to enforce consistent coding standards
- Use shareable configs like eslint-config-airbnb or eslint-config-standard as a foundation
- Implement custom rules for {{project_specific_patterns}} to maintain codebase consistency
- Configure integration with Prettier to avoid rule conflicts for code formatting
- Implement staged linting with husky and lint-staged to prevent committing non-compliant code

#### PRETTIER

- Define a consistent .prettierrc configuration across all {{project_repositories}}
- Configure editor integration to format on save for immediate feedback
- Use .prettierignore to exclude generated files, build artifacts, and {{specific_excluded_patterns}}
- Configure consistent quote style and semicolon usage to match team conventions
- Implement CI checks to ensure all committed code adheres to the defined style
