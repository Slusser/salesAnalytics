## CODING_PRACTICES

#### SWAGGER

- Define comprehensive schemas for all request and response objects
- Use semantic versioning in API paths to maintain backward compatibility
- Implement detailed descriptions for endpoints, parameters, and {{domain_specific_concepts}}
- Configure security schemes to document authentication and authorization requirements
- Use tags to group related endpoints by resource or functional area
- Implement examples for all endpoints to facilitate easier integration by consumers
